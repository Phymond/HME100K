# HME100K: A Dataset For Handwritten Mathematical Expression 

We introduce the HME100K dataset, a large-scale and real scene dataset suitable 
for evaluating handwritten mathematical expression recognition task.

### Image Collection

The data were collected from tens of thousands of writers who wrote the MEs on papers and uploaded them to an internet application. 

### Examples
